# one time tasks

## review and improve HTML markup

dse-static-cookiecutter already ships with some HTML markup; this markup is a grown copy, paste and modify mess and needs some work

* cleanup: check the correct usage of tags; remove not used classes
* accessibility: is the default markup accessibile (can I tab through the pages)
* basic SEO: lang tags, meta tags

## css best practices

ideally stick with bootstrap but learn (proivde examples) how to customize bootstrap correctly; when to use/override variables; or how to use something like less

## develop and implement JS components for common tasks

* page/text sync
* de-micro-editor
* https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/calendar-component
* https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/network-visualisation 
  * currently AMP and Schnitzler Briefe are implementing network-visualisations via Highcharts.js although highcharts is not very usable for network-visualisation due to poor performance


# per project task

* ideally people from both groups should work together on one project
* frontend group should code review HTML/CSS/JS code implemented in DSE-static projects
