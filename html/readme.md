> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We are going to have an extra session on this topic soon(is); ideally with someone from the frontend group. My idea would be that someone from the frontend group reviews one or several of our applications in regards of correct useage of HTML tags and accessiblity; candidates to review: staribacher, emt, ofm-graz

## (semantic) HTML
* respect the (littel) semantic in HTML tags!
* bad practice: meaningless `<h1>`; introduced by default cookie cutter

* better example: https://histories-in-transition.github.io/hit-python-static/hit_mansuscript__1.html

## Accessiblity

* usage of icons is nice, but not very accessible if done wrong
  * [bad practice](https://histories-in-transition.github.io/hit-python-static/hit_mansuscript__1.html): just the icon, no text
  * [good practice](https://histories-in-transition.github.io/hit-python-static/hit_mansuscript__1.html); us the icon but hide it to screenreader (`aria-hidden="true"`) AND add some text but hide it (in bootstrap with `class="visually-hidden"`)
